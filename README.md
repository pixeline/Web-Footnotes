# Web-Footnotes
WordPress plugin that implements footnotes adapted for the web. 

Web Footnotes parses your posts for notes wrapped in ((double parenthesis)), 
which are then reformatted as Daring Fireball-style footnotes.

# Example
The footnotes in this [article on Karoo (in French)](https://karoo.me/scene/entretien-david-strosberg#fn2-19376) are done via this plugin.
